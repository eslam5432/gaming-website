                            Behaviour Interactive, and published by Bethesda Softworks. Part of the Fallout series, it
                            was
                            released worldwide for iOS devices in June 2015, for Android devices in August 2015, for
                            Microsoft Windows in July 2016, Xbox One in February 2017, and PlayStation 4 and Nintendo
                            Switch

                            enjoyed the game's extension of the Fallout universe, the core gameplay, and its visual
                            style.
                            Common criticisms included the game's lack of depth, its use of unnecessary
                            microtransactions,
                            and its lack of an ending. The game grossed US$5.1 million (equivalent to about $5.5M in
                            2019)
                            in microtransaction sales in the first two weeks after its release.

                        <p>FM19 features similar gameplay to that of the Football Manager series. Gameplay consists of
                            taking charge of an association football team (club or nation) as the team manager. Players
                            can
                            sign footballers to contracts, manage club finances and give team talks to players. FM19 is
                            a
                            simulation of real-world management, with the manager being judged on various factors by the
                            club's AI owners and board.[4]In FM19, the game features new expanded modes, featuring the
                            addition of video assistant referees (VAR) in tournaments where it is used in the real world
                            (the FIFA World Cup 2022, for example).[5] FM19 also features an overhaul to the existing
                            training mechanic, allowing more in-depth training abilities. This version also features
                            updated
                            teams, including — as a first for the series — the licence to the three Bundesliga
                            divisions.
