                            were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000

                            film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction.

                            the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and
                            equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area

                            Entertainment. Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of
                            six,
                            with each player selecting from a roster of over 30 characters, known as "heroes", each with

                            unique style of play that is divided into three general roles that fit their purpose.
                            Players on
                            a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across

                        <p>Paladins takes place in a sci-fi fantasy world. There are elements of both fantasy and
                            science
                            fiction, including medieval-looking soldiers who use ranged weapons such as shotguns and
                            assault
                            rifles instead of swords.

                            In the world of Paladins, there is a conflict between two factions; the Magistrate and the
                            Paladins. Champions were recruited in order to minimize casualties of regular foot soldiers.
                            The
                            champions would be considered "special forces" as they are more efficient at combat than a
                            regular soldier. Not all champions are committed, however. There were a few who did not pick
                            sides during the war, rather they would contract with both, rendering them mercenaries. The
                            rest
                            of these special forces were committed to a faction, either the Magistrate or the
                            Paladins/Resistance.

                            emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes
                            control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage,
                            defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign
                            but
                            features a series of short, offline missions called, "situations" that can be played solo.
